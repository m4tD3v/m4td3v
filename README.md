## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

![alt text](https://nudi.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pink-and-Black-Duo-Tone-Seamless-Carousel-Instagram-Post.png)


I'm a nudibranchist. If that was ever a word, but nud1st probably wouldn't go down well on here (and I'm not one of those!) 

What is a nudibranchist, you might ask? If it were a legitimate word, it would probably be someone who likes nudibranchs - too much!

Using my background in tech, I built a Flutter app to help identify and log these colourful sea slugs from your rock pooling or diving adventures. They're really popular among divers, and have somewhat of a cult following. If I'm not working, improving the app or watching Formula 1, you'll probably find me under the sea!

My passions obviously have some influence on my work as a most of my background is in Sea Sharp (C what I did there?)

Enough hullabaloo, let's get to the professional aspect:

I'm a Senior developer with a wealth of Software Development experience who can switch up languages and frameworks but still align with core principles such as SOLID, KISS and Clean code Architectures.

I've worked in Telecommunications, Engineering and Payments and enjoy working on complex tasks where I get to build usable solutions. Python, C#, Dart, TypeScript and JavaScript are my main languages I've worked in, but I'm happy to learn and learn fast when needed.

I've worked with on-premises systems and cloud hosted solutions using AWS, and I'm happy to take on DevOps tasks and processes. I enjoy building end-to end solutions, and although I primarily focus on Backend, I'm happy to sell my soul and build frontends.

In the end, I just want to build cool sh1t!

As Software Program Manager at Brsk, my role primarily focused on the well being of developers and planning and delivering of commitments to business.

I've found micro-planning with my team works best, as we have lots of context switching, so we focus on weekly deliverables.

I joined Truevo in June 2022 and immediately felt welcomed into the team. Shortly before my probation ended, I was promoted to a lead role and guided and managed a team of 4 developers from mid - senior level. I enjoyed this responsibility working close with company management to achieve our goals. Unfortunately due to restructuring and retrenchments, the team was cut to less than half, and I assumed back to the role of Developer after 6 months. We built scalable and highly available services for the payments industry to allow secure realtime transactions. I worked with the Financial ledger, built up a fraud prevention and detection service and worked on several other transactional services and integrations. The core of our work was built using .NET microservices, Lambdas for Serverless, all interconnected with queues and rest apis, failsafes and multiple databases and caching mechanisms for speed.

 IXUS is one of the leading RF Safety compliance software providers worldwide. We have a host of solutions built using .NET Framework (for the legacy stuff) and .net core APIs setup with Aurelia (TypeScript) frontends for the newer solutions.

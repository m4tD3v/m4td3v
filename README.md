## Hi there 👋

I'm Matt, a 32 year old Software Developer/Engineer/Manager from South Africa 🇿🇦

I'm really a relaxed person, am easy to get on with and enjoy collaborating with others to share knowledge and implement cool solutions. 

I enjoy working out, being outdoors and keeping a healthy balanced lifestyle, with an unhealthy addiction to Scuba Diving and Rock-pooling! 🐬

Also a big F1 fan!🏎️

I co-founded and built an app in Flutter & Firebase 📱 [nudi.io](https://nudi.io) which is available on both iOS and Android and can be used to assist in identifying Nudibranchs (ask me about them!). We gained over 1000 users within our first month of launch.

## 👴 Experience
 - **Software Program Manager at [Brsk](brsk.co.uk)** *[2024/03 - present]*

At Brsk, I'm one of two Software program Managers. My role primarily focuses on the well being of developers and planning and delivering of commitments to business.

I've found micro-planning with my team works best, as we have lots of context switching, so we focus on weekly deliverables.

I lead a team of 7 permanent and 4 contractor developers and work closely with the architects and head of development to translate business requirements into developer friendly missions.

*Key Skills: Management, Project Planning, Python, DevOps*

 - **Software Developer at [Truevo](https://truevo.com) and [Rapaydo](https://www.rapaydo.com/)** 
 *[2022/06 - 2024/03]* **1y10m**
 
I joined Truevo in June 2022 and immediately felt welcomed into the team. Shortly before my probation ended, I was promoted to a lead role and guided and managed a team of 4 developers from mid - senior level. I enjoyed this responsibility working close with company management to achieve our goals. Unfortunately due to restructuring and retrenchments, the team was cut to less than half, and I assumed back to the role of Developer after 6 months. We built scalable and highly available services for the payments industry to allow secure realtime transactions. I worked with the Financial ledger, built up a fraud prevention and detection service and worked on several other transactional services and integrations. The core of our work was built using .NET microservices, Lambdas for Serverless, all interconnected with queues and rest apis, failsafes and multiple databases and caching mechanisms for speed.

 *Key Skills: AWS ECS, ECR, EC2, Lambda, KMS, RDS, DynamoDB, Redis, ActiveMQ, SQS, MSSQL, PostgreSQL, Docker, powershell, DevOps, C#, Python*

 IXUS is one of the leading RF Safety compliance software providers worldwide. We have a host of solutions built using .NET Framework (for the legacy stuff) and .net core APIs setup with Aurelia (TypeScript) frontends for the newer solutions. We also have multiple desktop apps written in C++ and C# which integrate with tens of different applications.

 *[2015/11 - 2017/01]* **1y2m**

My first Software development job was at ACI Worldwide, where I worked on the interchanges team, assisting with development on Enterprise level java applications according to ISO standards. It was a great introduction to good development standards and processes.

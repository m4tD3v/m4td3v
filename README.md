## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Matt, a 32 year old Software Developer/Engineer/Manager from South Africa.

I only started coding at Stellenbosch University, but I loved tech from probably before birth when the first ultrasound was taken of me in the belly. ðŸ˜‰

[Supaplex](https://www.google.com/search?q=supaplex) was my go to game from when I can first remember!

I'm really a relaxed person, am easy to get on with and enjoy collaborating with others to share knowledge. I enjoy working out, being outdoors and keeping a healthy balanced lifestyle, with an unhealthy addiction to Scuba Diving and Rock-pooling! Also a big F1 fan!

I co-founded and built an app in Flutter & Firebase ðŸ“± nudi.io which is available on both iOS and Android and can be used to assist in identifying Nudibranchs (ask me about them!). We gained over 1000 users within our first month of launch and are nearing 2000 in our 3rd month.

## ðŸ‘´ Experience
 - **Software Program Manager at [Brsk](brsk.co.uk)** *[2024/03 - present]*

At Brsk, I'm one of two Software program Managers. My role primarily focuses on the well being of developers and planning and delivering of commitments to business.

I've found micro-planning with my team works best, as we have lots of context switching, so we focus on weekly deliverables.

I lead a team of 7 permanent and 4 contractor developers and work closely with the architects and head of development to translate business requirements into developer friendly missions.
